# GUM Philosophy

## Why GUM Exists

GUM exists because modern input systems have become *intelligent* but not *familiar*.

They predict well.
They optimize averages.
They adapt to trends.

But they do not adapt to *you*.

GUM starts from a simple belief:

> Input is not just a technical act.  
> It is an expression of thought, hesitation, habit, and trust.

If a system ignores those human layers, it will always feel slightly foreign—no matter how accurate it becomes.

## The Core Belief

**Personalization should be gentle.**

Not fast.
Not aggressive.
Not impressive.

Gentle personalization means:
- it takes time
- it avoids sudden behavioral shifts
- it never demands attention
- it can be ignored without penalty

GUM does not try to *optimize* you.
It tries to *accompany* you.

## Why a User Model, Not a New IME

IME is one of the most sensitive layers in computing:
- latency-critical
- platform-bound
- deeply trusted by users

Replacing it is unrealistic.
Disrupting it is disrespectful.

GUM treats the IME as:

> a sacred final layer

Instead of rewriting that layer, GUM places a **user model beside it**.

A model that:
- observes from the outside
- learns from revisions, not raw input
- influences quietly, through existing mechanisms

This is why GUM is a *patch*, not a fork.

## What GUM Learns (and What It Refuses to Learn)

GUM is intentionally selective.

### GUM Learns:
- expressions you reuse over time
- explanations you stabilize on
- metaphors you trust
- sentence openings you return to
- corrections you make consistently

### GUM Refuses to Learn:
- everything you type
- private raw text by default
- emotional reactions
- behavioral scores
- real-time surveillance patterns

Learning less is not a limitation.
It is the design.

## The Idea of “Surface Memory”

GUM does not store deep thoughts.
It stores **surface memory**.

Surface memory is:
- short
- repeatable
- expressive
- easy to discard

It is the layer of language that sits *between* thinking and typing.

This makes it:
- safe to personalize
- safe to forget
- safe to override

If memory becomes heavy, it becomes controlling.
GUM avoids that.

---

## Bias Is Not a Bug

GUM is intentionally biased.

Not toward correctness.
Not toward popularity.

But toward *you*.

Bias in GUM means:
- preferring your phrasing over generic phrasing
- preferring your metaphors over common ones
- preferring recent habits over historical ones

This bias is:
- local
- reversible
- decaying over time

A bias that cannot fade is not personalization.
It is fossilization.

---

## Speech, Silence, and Hesitation

In GUM, speech recognition output is never treated as truth.

Corrections matter more than recognition.
Silence matters more than fluency.
Hesitation is a signal, not noise.

If you pause, GUM slows down.
If you correct, GUM learns.
If you ignore it, GUM retreats.

The system should adapt to your confidence—not demand it.

---

## Learning Must Be Invisible

If a system announces that it is learning, it changes behavior.

People become cautious.
They perform.
They self-edit.

GUM believes:

> If learning is visible, it is already failing.

There are no badges.
No notifications.
No dashboards demanding attention.

Only subtle improvements—or none at all.

---

## Local First Is a Moral Choice

Local-first is not only a technical decision.

It is an ethical one.

- your language belongs to you
- your habits are not a dataset
- personalization should not require exposure

Cloud integration is optional.
Local autonomy is not.

---

## What Success Looks Like

GUM is successful when:
- you forget it exists
- your IME feels calmer
- explanations come out the way you expect
- you correct yourself less often

The highest compliment to GUM is silence.

---

## Closing Thought

GUM is not about making machines smarter.

It is about making tools *feel familiar*.

> The future of input is not prediction.
> It is recognition.

Recognition of the person who is typing.
